    "Create a class called Frac to represent mathematical fractions. The class is instantiated with two instance variables: nominator and denominator. Objects instantiated from this class should have methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division using the operators +,-,*,/. Note that these implemented methods must be mathematically correct. Also implement the following methods:\n",
